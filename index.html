						<h3>Guideline 1.1 – Text Alternatives</h3>
						<p>Provide text alternatives for any non-text content so that it can be changed into other forms people need, such as large print, braille, speech, symbols or simpler language.<br>
						All non-text content that is presented to the user has a text alternative that serves the equivalent purpose, except for the situations listed below</p>
					</article>
					<article id="tab2">
						<h3>Guideline 1.2 – Time-based Media</h3>
						<p>Provide alternatives for time-based media.<br>
						For prerecorded audio-only and prerecorded video-only media, the following are true, except when the audio or video is a media alternative for text and is clearly labeled as such:<br>
						Captions are provided for all prerecorded audio content in synchronized media, except when the media is a media alternative for text and is clearly labeled as such.<br>
						An alternative for time-based media or audio description of the prerecorded video content is provided for synchronized media, except when the media is a media alternative for text and is clearly labeled as such.</p>
					</article>
					<article id="tab3">
						<h3>Guideline 1.3 – Adaptable</h3>
						<p>Create content that can be presented in different ways (for example simpler layout) without losing information or structure.<br>
						Information, structure, and relationships conveyed through presentation can be programmatically determined or are available in text.<br>
						When the sequence in which content is presented affects its meaning, a correct reading sequence can be programmatically determined<br>
						Instructions provided for understanding and operating content do not rely solely on sensory characteristics of components such as shape, size, visual location, orientation, or sound.</p>
					</article>
					<article id="tab4">
						<h3>Guideline 1.4 – Distinguishable</h3>
						<p>Make it easier for users to see and hear content including separating foreground from background<br>
						Color is not used as the only visual means of conveying information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual element.<br>
						If any audio on a Web page plays automatically for more than 3 seconds, either a mechanism is available to pause or stop the audio, or a mechanism is available to control audio volume independently from the overall system volume level.<br>
						The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1</p>
					</article>
					<article id="tab5">
						<h3>Guideline 2.1 – Keyboard Accessible</h3>
						<p>Make all functionality available from a keyboard.<br>
						All functionality of the content is operable through a keyboard interface without requiring specific timings for individual keystrokes, except where the underlying function requires input that depends on the path of the user's movement and not just the endpoints.<br>
						If keyboard focus can be moved to a component of the page using a keyboard interface, then focus can be moved away from that component using only a keyboard interface, and, if it requires more than unmodified arrow or tab keys or other standard exit methods, the user is advised of the method for moving focus away.<br>
						All functionality of the content is operable through a keyboard interface without requiring specific timings for individual keystrokes.</p>
